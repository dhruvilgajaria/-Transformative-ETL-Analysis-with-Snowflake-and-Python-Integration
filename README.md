# Transformative-ETL-Analysis-with-Snowflake-and-Python-Integration
Integrated diverse data sets (CSV, XML, PostgreSQL) to analyze weather impact on purchase order discrepancies. Implemented automated data staging and managed Snowflake warehouse operations, enhancing data processing efficiency through the development of complex SQL queries for analysis.
This project highlights advanced data integration and analysis using Snowflake Data Cloud. It involved connecting to Snowflake, creating warehouses, databases, and schemas, and managing data from various sources including CSV and XML files. The process included efficient data ingestion into Snowflake tables, adding calculated fields, and performing complex data joins. A key aspect was integrating geolocation and weather data, providing insights into how environmental factors impact supplier transactions. This comprehensive approach demonstrated the capabilities of cloud data platforms in synthesizing and analyzing large datasets to extract valuable business insights.
